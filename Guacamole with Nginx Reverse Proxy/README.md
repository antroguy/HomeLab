**Home Lab - Setting up Guacamole Server**
The purpose of this guide is to provide instructional value on how to deploy a Guacamole server as a jump server for a home network.
This guide will provide instrucction on how to deploy a guacamole server and mysql server using docker instances, how to set up SSL encryption for the guac server using nginx as a reverse proxy, and how to generate an SSL certificate through letsencrypt.

**Requirements:**
* Ubuntu 18.04 most recent version or sooner. The version is not critical since I will be using dockers to deploy both my guacamole and mysql server.
  * Ubuntu 18.04 ISO can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/. I will be using ESXI to host my ubuntu server.
* Ability to NAT/port forward services from your router (I am using pfsense as my firewall)
* Ownership of a domain (I purchased my domain through google domains)

On your Ubuntu server install the docker tool.
```
$ sudo apt install docker.io”
```
Pull the guacamole/guacd, guacamole/guacamole, and mysql docker containers.
```
$ sudo docker pull guacamole/guacd
```
```
$ sudo docker pull guacamole/guacamole
```
```
$ sudo docker pull mysql
```

Now we will set up the guacamole/guacd container, this will provide the guacamole guacd daemon that will accept and manage user connections. Run the following command, where _guacd-name_ is the name you will assign to your guacamole/guacd container. The _-d_ argument runs the docker container in the background.
```
$ sudo docker run -d –name guacd-name guacamole/guacd
```
Next we will set up the mysql container. First create an sql database structure for the guacamole database. Fortunately there is a initdb.sh script that will create the guacamole database structure. 
```
$ docker run –rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --mysql > initdb.sql
```
Start the mysql container, where _sql-name_ is the name you will assign the sql container, and _mypassword_ is the root password for mysql.
```
sudo docker run -d –name=sql-name –env=”MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword” mysql
```
Download mysql-client in order to connect to the mysql database.
```
sudo apt install mysql-client
```
Inspect the mysql container for the containers ip address. 
```
sudo docker inspect sqlDocker
```
Connect to the mysql server using the IP address identified in the previous step.
```
$ mysql -u root -p -h 172.15.0.2
```
Once connected to the mysql server, create the guacamole database.
```
$ create database guacamole_db
```
If you type “show databases” from the cli, you should now see see the guacamole database you created. Exit the mysql server. 
Next  we have to set up the guacamole_db structure. We ill import the initdb.sql file that we created previously into the guacamole_db. 
```
mysql -u root -p -h 172.17.0.2 guacamole_db < initdb.sql
```
Log back into sql server via mysql-client and type in “use guacamole_db” to access the guacamole database. Create a user for the guacamole server using the following command. (NOTE: _guacadmin_ is the username you want to create for the guacamole service, and _password_ is the password you want to assign to the user. The _%_  is used to allow the guacamole account to login from any host.
```
$ create user ‘guacadmin’@’%’ identified by ‘password’; 
```
Next, grant all privledges to the guacamole account to the guacamole database.
```
$ Grant all privileges on guacamole_db.* to ‘guacadmin’@’localhost’;
```
You can type in the following commands to verify the guacamole service account has been created and granted the appropriate privledges.
```
select host, user from mysql.user;” 
```
```
show grants for ‘guacadmin’@’localhost’; 
```
You should now be able to access your guacamole web application opening a web browser and going to http://localhost:8080/guacamole/.
